Cost Optimization Review Summary

Upon examining the current AWS resources, several areas for improvement have been identified:

Over-provisioning of multiple AWS resources has been noted, and a detailed list of these over-provisioned resources has been compiled.
Several unused resources are active during weekends and off-hours, leading to unnecessary costs.
To address these issues, the following solutions are proposed:

Adjust instance sizes and quantities to align with workload demands, particularly in lower environments, to mitigate over-provisioning.
Implement scheduled shutdowns and resource terminations during weekends and off-hours for non-production environments.
In pursuit of cost optimization, the following actions have already been taken:

Lower environment reviews have been conducted, resulting in the cleanup of all unused servers.
The number of servers in each category has been reduced to the minimum required.
Financial Implications:

Upon implementing these proposals, cost reductions are estimated to be significant across different environments, with specific impacts as follows:

Dev:
QA:
Staging:
It's important to note that the review primarily focuses on lower environments (DEV, QA, and Staging), whereas intentional over-provisioning is maintained in production and performance environments.
