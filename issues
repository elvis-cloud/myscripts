WebLogic Monitoring with Datadog
We are recommending the integration of Datadog with our WebLogic servers to enhance monitoring and operational awareness.

Implementation Overview
Enable remote monitoring on WebLogic.

Configure Datadog to collect key performance metrics.

Set up dashboards and alerts for real-time tracking.

Enable log monitoring for deeper visibility.

Key Business Advantages
1. Improved Visibility and Control
Gain real-time insight into the health and performance of WebLogic servers. This enables better oversight and decision-making based on live data rather than assumptions or delays.

2. Proactive Issue Detection
Automated alerts will notify the team when issues begin to emerge, allowing us to take action before they impact users or systemsâ€”greatly reducing the risk of unplanned downtime.

3. Faster Troubleshooting
Having centralized metrics and logs simplifies investigations. When a problem arises, teams can quickly identify the root cause, reducing the time it takes to recover and improving service reliability.
