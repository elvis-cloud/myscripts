Cost optimization summary 

After reviewing the AWS resources currently in use, we observed the following. 

- Multiple AWS resources are over provisioned. We have put together a list of over provisioned resoureces. 
- Multiple unused resources are running over the weekend and during off hours. 

The possible pending solutions to address these issues are as follows;

- To adjust instance sizes and numbers to match workload requirements and avoid over provisioning in the lower environments. 
- Schedule the shutting down of resources over the weekends and possibly during off hours for non production environments.

We have already implemented the following:

- Reviewed the lower environments and cleaned up all unused servers. 
- Reduced the number of servers in each server category to the minimum.
