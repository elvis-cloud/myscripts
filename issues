Cost optimization review summary 

After reviewing the AWS resources currently in use, we observed the following. 

- Multiple AWS resources are over provisioned. We have put together a list of over provisioned resources. 
- Multiple unused resources are running over the weekend and during off hours. 

The possible pending solutions to address these issues are as follows;

- To adjust instance sizes and numbers to match workload requirements and avoid over provisioning in the lower environments. 
- Schedule the shutting down and termination of resources over the weekends and possibly during off hours for non production environments.

In line with the cost optimization effort, we have already implemented the following:

- Reviewed the lower environments and cleaned up all unused servers. 
- Reduced the number of servers in each server category to the minimum. 

Financial implications:
After reviewing the above proposals, we estimate that implementing these proposals will reduce costs in the different environments as follows.
Dev: 
QA:
Staging: 

The review focuses on the lower environments namely DEV, QA and Stage. The production and performance environments are over provisioned on purpose.
